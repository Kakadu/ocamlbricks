(** Similar to [Thread.create] with two differences:
    (1) you may create a killable thread (but only a limited number of threads 
        of your application may be killable at the same time)
    (2) you are able to call [ThreadExtra.at_exit] in the function ('a -> 'b) 
        that will be executed in the created thread. *)
